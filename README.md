# DormRate

Ever wondered if you could find the best rated rooms on campus? DormRate lets users rate their rooms on campus, and everyone can see the rooms, their decorations, and can ask questions!

Let's make room selection easier than ever before!

This site shows my experience with Ruby on Rails so far. I worked on the frontend, backend, site integration, and I am currently working on image hosting via an AWS S3 bucket. This site is testament to my web-development capabilities, and is a project I can proudly talk about.

## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```
